#Haxing
Currently, the project has an AudioManager in progress which is Singleton-like 
and a player that moves down and has a Animation Manager.

Forrest Shooster is Argzero.
Yawar Raza is YawarRaza7349.

Argzero made the base setup for the project, implemented movement and is working on the AudioManager class. 
YawarRaza7349 worked on the graphics side of the project and set up the player's animations, importing a spritesheet, 
and splitting it for the various animations. We each explored the AnimatedFloat type and learned about how it works, 
using it for our implementation of the player for movement and animation.

There is also a line for running the music in the game in the project and three versions of the music for the project 
to use depending upon the platform as instructed in the Flambe documentation, however this line is commented out while 
Argzero implements the AudioManager class.

#ACCREDITATION
The music belongs to Argzero under Creative Commons.
The [spritesheet art](http://opengameart.org/content/base-character-spritesheet-16x16) belongs to a user on the open 
game art website under CC0 license but we thought it kind to put a link here.
